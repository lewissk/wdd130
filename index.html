        Hello! My name is Scott Lewis and I live in Herriman, Utah. I enjoy 
        mountain biking, climbing, skiing, and camping. My parents had a small 
        farm and I did a lot of ranching and farming with my parents and 
        siblings. I served a mission in the Rome Italy mission where I served 
        in Florence, Naples, Sardegna, and Rome. I married my lovely wife and 
        sealed in the Salt Lake Temple. My wife and I have 4 children. I have 
        been a programmer for a long time and have coded in javascript, scala, 
        java, python, go, swift and kotlin. I love to do 3d printing and 
        electronic circuit boards to make various things. I have lived in 
        San Jose California, Phoenix AZ, and in many places in Utah. I have a 
        pet golden retriever named Enzo who is two years old. Enzo loves to 
        play fetch with a ball, go for walks, and play with his stuffed animals.
        I also have a 3d printer that I use to create things that I come up with
        using Autodesk Fusion 360. I am currently working on a project to create
        an Ironman costume that I will have displayed in my basement where I 
        have my flight simulator and soon to have my full motion Formula 1
        racing simulator.

            Utah is a great state in the USA. The best skiing and mountain 
            biking, and the most beautiful red rock arches in the world!
